        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 Slices of Pork Loin</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>2 eggs, Beaten</li>
            <li>Panko</li>
            <li>Vegetable Oil for Pan Frying</li>
            <li>Shredded Nappa Cabbage</li>
            <li>Lemon Wedges</li>
            <li>Tonkatsu Sauce</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Slash the fat rimming one side of the loin cutlet to keep the meat from curling when deepfried. Pound to flatten to about 1/4 inch. Salt and pepper both sides of each cutlet. Dredge each in flour, then dip into beaten eggs and press into bread crumbs to coat both sides.</li>
            <li>Heat a large skillet with about 1/2 inch of oil until hot. Lay 1 or 2 cutlets in the hot oil. Deep-fry until golden brown, about 5 to 7 minutes, turning them once or twice. Drain the cutlets on paper towels and cut the pork into bite-size strips that can be eaten with chopsticks.</li>
            <li>Arrange the pork on a platter lined with the shredded cabbage, and garnish with lemon wedges. Serve the sauce on the side for dipping, or pour it over the pork and cabbage.</li>
